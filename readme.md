# Helper Bot ðŸ¤–

A framework around [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org) for implementing simple bot behaviour in bite-sized chunks.

## The code

Check out `index.js` to see how it works âœ¨. It's really quite simple, so it might be better to read `example.js` and the provided middlewares to see how to use it.

This bot had it's humble beginnings in Dan Reeves' example: [1337 bot](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/discord-bot-example?path=README.md:1:0)
